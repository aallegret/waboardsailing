          WA Boardsailing is a group of windsurfers and wingers who mostly
          live in Washington.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here you will find information about local launches, wind
          forecasting, and even how to get started windsurfing or winging.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also find some information for WA boardsailors heading
          further afield. (So you may see some information on The Gorge or
          Maui, but this is not a definitive source for that information.)
        </p>
        <p>
          WA Boardsailing is mostly populated by windsurfers and wingers. If
          you are a kiter, you will find some good information here, but you
          will also want to look for a dedicated NW Kiting group, like
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/608389315944697"
            >NW Kiteboarders</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to help new people get into
          windsurfing/winging, experienced sailors to learn new areas, and
          visitors to jump right in. This site is not comprehensive with
          every answer to every question. For that, you should join the
          <a href="https://groups.io/g/nw-windtalk"
            >nw-windtalk email list</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many different disciplines and names for what this group
          is about: windsurfing, windfoiling, foil boarding, winging,
          kiteboarding, kite foiling, etc. We will usually just use one term
          - "boardsailing". It applies to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, boardsailing is dangerous. You can die. Seriously. While
          we strive to be accurate, we are just imperfect volunteers. Use at
          your own risk and read our<a
