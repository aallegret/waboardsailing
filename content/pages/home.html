                NW Windtalk shares information about windsurfing and winging in
                the Pacific Northwest.

            <p>
              NW Windtalk is mostly populated by people in the Puget Sound and
              Northern Washington area. Here you will find extensive information
              on northern Washington launches and other local information, as
              well beginning information for NW windsurfers heading further
              afield. (So you may see some information on The Gorge or Maui, but
              this is not the definitive source for that information.)
            </p>
            <p>
              NW Windtalk is also mostly populated by windsurfers and
              windsurfers who have migrated to winging. If you are a kiter, you
              will find some good information here, but you will also want to
              look for dedicated NW Kiting groups, like
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/608389315944697"
                >NW Kiteboarders</a

              The purpose of this site is to help new people get into
              windsurfing/winging, experienced sailors to learn new areas, and
              visitors jump right in. This site is not comprehensive with every
              answer to every question. For that, you should join the
              <a href="https://groups.io/g/nw-windtalk"

              There are many different disciplines and names for what this group
              is about: windsurfing, windfoiling, foil boarding, winging,
              kiteboarding, kite foiling, etc. We will usually just use one term
              - "boardsailing". It applies to all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, boardsailing is dangerous. You can die. Seriously. While
              we strive to be  accurate, we are just imperfect volunteers. Use
              at your own risk and read our<a
