            <p>
              WA Boardsailing is a group of windsurfers and wingers who mostly live 
              in Washington. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Here you will find information about local launches, wind forecasting,
              and even how to get started windsurfing or winging. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You will also find some information for WA boardsailors heading further
              afield. (So you may see some information on The Gorge or Maui, but
              this is a definitive source for that information.)
            </p>
            <p>
              WA Boardsailing is also mostly populated by windsurfers and
              windsurfers who have migrated to winging. If you are a kiter, you
              will find some good information here, but you will also want to
              look for dedicated NW Kiting groups, like
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/608389315944697"
                >NW Kiteboarders</a
              >.

            <p>
              The purpose of this site is to help new people get into
              windsurfing/winging, experienced sailors to learn new areas, and
              visitors to jump right in. This site is not comprehensive with every
              answer to every question. For that, you should join the
              <a href="https://groups.io/g/nw-windtalk"
                >nw-windtalk email list</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many different disciplines and names for what this group
              is about: windsurfing, windfoiling, foil boarding, winging,
              kiteboarding, kite foiling, etc. We will usually just use one term
              - "boardsailing". It applies to all.

              Finally, boardsailing is dangerous. You can die. Seriously. While
              we strive to be  accurate, we are just imperfect volunteers. Use
              at your own risk and read our<a
