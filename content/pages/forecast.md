# Forecasting

Where is it going to blow? Ah, the perennial question that plagues us boardsailors.

Forecasting the Seattle region can be quite difficult, especially since we
are often sailing marginal conditions where the difference of 3 mph can mean
the difference between a great day and a frustrating failure.

Becoming *great* at forecasting is beyond the scope of this site. Instead, you'll
want to get involved in the [nw-windtalk email group](https://groups.io/g/nw-windtalk)
and talk up your fellow sailors. And experiment. And learn to read tea leaves.

Here you will hopefully find enough information for the beginner or interemediate WA
boadsailor get started.
