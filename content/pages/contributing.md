# Contributing

Are you an experience WA sailor? If so, this website needs _your_ help.

If a lot of people contribute a little effort, we can create a great resource
for people getting started boardsailing in WA.

I (the website builder - <a href="mailto:cab_mall0n@icloud.com" >Ross Rosen</a>)
can put the site together, but I do not have the expertise to build the content. 
That's where the community steps in.

I'd like to have different people "own" different pages. For instance, someone
could "own" the [Sail Sand Point page](/pages/sites/ssp.html). They would write
the content so someone new to sailing or new to Seattle would get a pretty good
idea of if they should try it, when to go (forecasting), and any tips.

These articles should _mostly_ be focused on beginners and interemediates. If
you want to put more info in for experts, put it at the bottom of the page in an
area labeled "Advanced Topics". Even there, try not to be too controversial.
If there is significant disagreement between experts, refer to it in the
"NW-Windtalk Threads" section.

## Technical Expertise

This site is written in a modified version of ["Markdown"](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).
It would be much easier for me if all contributors would spend a little time and learn Markdown.
But you don't have to. If you send me a plain text file, I will manually import it into Markdown.

## How To

This website uses a website builder call [Pelican](https://getpelican.com). It uses
Markdown, with some "meta data" at the top, and with a custom theme that I built. 
Below is an example of the Markdown for the Magnusson page.
