# Sail Sand Point

*(aka: SSP )*

## Overview

There are two main launches in Seattle's Magnusson Park - this one (SSP),
which is best in a northerly wind, and [Mags](/sites/mags),
which is best in a southerly.

In a northerly (especially NE), SSP is one of the safest launches around.
The wind will push you back to shore and the launch area is large and gentle.
SSP is also home to the [Sail Sand Point](https://www.sailsandpoint.org) boating center. You can rent windsurfers and even take lessons. (TRUE????)

## Forecasting

"Both ECMWF and HRRR, while not flawless, have lately been so accurate for SSP thermals that when consistent, I've started just rigging according to the forecast, even when the meter hasn't yet begun winding up.  For SSP, add 1-3 mph to the ECMWF and HRRR forecasts to compensate for resolution limits.

Windy offers a particularly clear comparative forecast picture that includes ECMWF and HRRR:
