# Vantage

From Guislain:  

specifically these launch sites literally 5mins from each other, which makes Vantage a good destination regardless of wind directions:

- Sand Hollow Campground, best for dominant and strong W by NW thermal winds as well as milder SW winds,
- Wanapum State Park, good for NE, E, SE winds, but dangerous with dominant W by NW winds because of the canyon wind shadow,
- Vantage Boat launch, good for rare northerlies
