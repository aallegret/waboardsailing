Welcome to NW WindTalk[edit | edit source]
NW Windtalk shares information about windsurfing and winging in the Pacific Northwest.

NW Windtalk is mostly populated by people in the Puget Sound and Northern Washington area. So here you will find extensive information on northern Washington launches and other local information, as well beginning information for NW windsurfers heading further afield. (So you may see some information on The Gorge or Maui, but this is not the definitive source for that information.)

NW Windtalk is also mostly populated by windsurfers and windsurfers who have migrated to winging. If you are a kiter, you will find some good information here, but you will also want to look for dedicated NW Kiting groups, like NW Kiteboarders.

The purpose of this site is to help new people get into windsurfing/winging, experienced sailors to learn new areas, and visitors jump right in.

This site is not comprehensive with every answer to every question. For that, you should join the nw-windtalk email list.

There are many different disciplines and names for what this group is about: windsurfing, windfoiling, foil boarding, winging, kiteboarding, kite foiling, etc. We will usually just use one term - "windsurfing". It applies to all.

Finally, windsurfing is dangerous. You can die. Seriously. While we strive to be as accurate, we are just imperfect volunteers. Use at your own risk and read our warning page.
