# MediaWiki Version

This version is based on MediaWiki running in a docker container.

* Docker container with docker compose
* Custom Dockerfile to add software to mediawiki container
* Custom PHP (via Dockerfile)
    * Chameleon skin
    * Some extensions (some of which don't seem to work)


# Conclusion

I hate Mediawiki.

I'm sure I could get it to do what I want but it's very ugly and idiosyncratic. 
Worse, I'm highly skeptical other potential editors would go through the learning 
curve to contribute. So I get all the development annoyances and overhead of 
mediawiki without the only reason I tried it - lots of editors contributing directly. 

I've put too much time into this, but I think it's a bad choice.

I'm going to try a simple static site generator and see if people contribute via 
Markdown files. 

I don't know if they will, but I think it is at least as likely as that they use markdown
than that they use wikimedia.

And I will be happier.
